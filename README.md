# rippy
Wrapper around makemkv for more easily ripping dvds and blu-rays.

This is a poorly written program, use at own risk lol.

Main useful features:
  - With movies, will list all titles sorted by runtime.
  - With shows, will loop over multiple episodes on the same disc, formatting
    episode titles nicely. *(Update: I have found that some shows do not order their episodes nicely on the disc, so reordering may be necessary)*
